# Redux-fly

## Installation
React-fly requires **React 15.x**, **Redux 3.x** and **React Redux 4.x**.
```
npm install --save redux-fly
```

This assumes that you’re using npm package manager with a module bundler like Webpack or Browserify to consume CommonJS modules.

If you don’t yet use npm or a modern module bundler, and would rather prefer a single-file UMD build that makes ReduxFly available as a global object, you can grab a pre-built versions: [full](https://unpkg.com/redux-fly/dist/redux-fly.js) and
 [minified](https://unpkg.com/redux-fly/dist/redux-fly.min.js).
