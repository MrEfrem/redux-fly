# Redux-fly
The purpose of library to provide simple API for:
* Reducers registration at any time to any place in store of Redux. This improvement is providing of code splitting, encapsulation of reducer logic for creation of reused components.
* Creation and controlling component state which is saved in store of Redux. Providing interaction between components through API Redux: actions dispatch, state selectors.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MrEfrem/redux-fly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MrEfrem/redux-fly)

## Installation
React-fly requires **React 15.x**, **Redux 3.x** and **React Redux 4.x**.
```
npm install --save redux-fly
```

This assumes that you’re using npm package manager with a module bundler like Webpack or Browserify to consume CommonJS modules.

If you don’t yet use npm or a modern module bundler, and would rather prefer a single-file UMD build that makes ReduxFly available as a global object, you can grab a pre-built versions: [full](https://unpkg.com/redux-fly/dist/redux-fly.js) and
 [minified](https://unpkg.com/redux-fly/dist/redux-fly.min.js).
